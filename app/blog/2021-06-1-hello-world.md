Welcome to the [**canontech**](https://github.com/canontech) blog! We are in the early phases of launching, so keep an eye out here for educational content and tooling for validators and nominators.

As a brief intro to who we are:

The canontech team is resolute in providing best in class staking infrastructure to the Polkadot and Kusama networks (with the potential for collating on parachains and parathreads in the future as well).

We bring experience from working full time on substrate tooling to our staking operations. Our core belief is that a more diverse validator set creates a more resilient network, and helps prevent major downside events for nominators.
