Welcome to the [**canontech**](https://github.com/canontech) blog! We are in the early phases of launching, so keep an eye out here for educational content and tooling for validators and nominators.

The canontech team is resolute in providing secure infrastructure to the Polkadot and Kusama networks.

Our core belief is that a more diverse validator set creates a more resilient network, and helps prevent major downside events for nominators.
